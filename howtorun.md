## to run

you need to make node is installed on your laptop aswell as git to have a git-bash terminal
once that is done, just make sure to open a gitbash terminal on vscode or such apps, then run npm i , then run npm start 
it might start on 12750 or such port, but it will only work on localhost:3000
